### Objective

Your assignment explores the included "The Office" dataset. Your task is to create a report on the dataset using Jupyter.

### Brief

Everyone loves "The Office," a popular show that aired from 2005 to 2013. While doing research, you stumbled across this dataset, with the lines of all the episodes. You decide to explore the dataset and answer some questions in a Jupyter notebook.

### Tasks

Your first task is to create a Jupyter notebook and add the `. ipynb` file to the repository. You will work on this notebook for the rest of the challenge.

We want you to answer the following questions:

-   How many characters are there? What are their names?
-   For each character, find out who has the most lines across all episodes
-   What is the average of words per line for each character?
-   What is the most common word per character
-   Number of episodes where the character does not have a line, for each character
-   The average percent of lines each character contributed each episode per season.
-   Come up with 2-3 interesting questions yourself surrounding the dataset

### Evaluation Criteria

-   The report is easy to read, and its sections are well divided
-   The data exploration is done in an easy-to-understand way
-   Any graph or figure created is clear and easy to read
-   All the questions are answered. Even if the answer is incorrect, the arguments and how you are presenting them is valuable

### CodeSubmit

Please organize, design, test, and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes to the
master branch. After you have pushed your code, you may submit the assignment on the assignment page.

All the best and happy coding,
